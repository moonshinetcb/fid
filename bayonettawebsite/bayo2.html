<h1>Bayonetta 2</h1>
<h2>The Comprehensive Bayonetta Guide</h2>

<p>Bayonetta 2 follows Bayonetta on a journey that not only shows us more lore for her world, but also allows us to go back into the past and see what truly led up to the birth of Bayonetta.</p>

<p>This game not only follows Bayonetta fighting Angels, but also Demons as well as Bayonetta goes into the very gates of hell, otherwise known as Inferno to find her childhood friend.</p>

<p>This game is a big improvement to Bayonetta 1, as not-only the art style is improved, but the gameplay, story, weapons, and witch abilities give this game a fresh sense of newness as Bayonetta now rocks a new look with new guns, ready to solve the conflicts within this world.</p>
