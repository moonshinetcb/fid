<h1>Bayonetta’s Unique Arsenal of Weapons</h1>
<h2>The Comprehensive Bayonetta Guide</h2>

<h2>Scarborough Fair</h2>

<img src="scarboroughfair.png" alt="weapon">

<p>A powerful set of handguns Bayonetta uses as her default weapon of choice. They are very powerful weapons. Scarborough Fair has versions in both Bayonetta 2 and 3 called Love is Blue and Color my World which all have similar abilities and all have the shared ability to summon the limbs of Madama Butterfly to aid Bayonetta in battle.</p>

<h2>修羅刃, Shuraba</h2>

<img src="shuraba.png" alt="Weapon">

<p>A living demonic sword said to possess the power of the demon god of war Ashura.</p> 

<h2>Alruna</h2>

<img src="Alruna.png" alt="Weapon">

<p>The Alruna is a pair of whip weapons that are attached to Bayonetta’s ankles and wrists. They are powerful long range weapons that can grab enemies and slam them into the ground.</p>

<h2>Salamandra</h2>

<img src="salamandra.png" alt="Weapon">

<p>A very wild pair of chainsaw swords that appear in Bayonetta 2 that can be equipped on the hands and feet of Bayonetta herself. These chainsaw swords are well…chainsaw swords, and attack with immense force and power.</p>

<h2>G-Pillar</h2>

<img src="gpillar.png" alt="Weapon">

<p>A powerful weapon only available in Bayonetta 3 and (minor spoiler) comes from the corpse of the demon Gamorrah’s biological tissue. G-Pillar is a massive club/rifle combination weapon that fires massive projectiles and bashes opponents with the hammer-end of the weapon with immense force.</p>

<p>Bayonetta has many weapons at her disposal in order to face any threat that comes her way.</p>
