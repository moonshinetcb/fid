<h1>Bayonetta 3</h1>
<h2>The Comprehensive Bayonetta Guide</h2>


<p>This game follows a powerful Bayonetta that isn’t fighting Angels OR Demons this time, but instead fighting a new world-ending threat that is man-made. The Homunculi.</p>

<img src="bayo3.png" alt="Bayonetta">

<p>Bayonetta fights not only for herself, but for the world as she defends the world from this massive threat that’s been Bayonetta’s biggest challenge yet!</p>

<p>In this game Bayonetta is sporting an all-new glorious outfit with new purple guns! A mix of the red guns from Bayonetta 1 and the blue guns from Bayonetta 2!</p>

<p>Thankfully, there are many helpful allies that help Bayonetta on the way. While there is so much to say about this game, anything further would be spoilers for the game, so I will not say them here.</p>
