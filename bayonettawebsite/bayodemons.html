<h1>Bayonetta’s Infernal Demons</h1>
<h2>The Comprehensive Bayonetta Guide</h2>

<p>Throughout all Bayonetta games, Bayonetta controls mighty demons that come from the hellish realm of Inferno. These demons are immensely powerful entities that help Bayonetta pull off powerful attacks on her enemies. In this page I will be highlighting some of the many demons Bayonetta uses in the series!</p>

<h2>Madama Butterfly, Mistress of Atrocity</h2>

<img src="butterfly.png" alt="Demon">

<p>Bayonetta’s arguable favorite and signature demon, a powerful and wicked woman of Inferno that made an unknown pact with Bayonetta and is the origin of most of Bayonetta’s demonic attacks. Demented and pure evil, using her powerful attacks to punch and stomp Angels to feathers.</p>

<p>Fun-fact: Madame Butterfly’s silhouette can even be seen in Bayonetta’s shadow!</p>

<h2>Gomorrah, Devourer of the Divine</h2>

<img src="gomorrah.png" alt="Demon">

<p>A powerful denizen of inferno hailing from the Johnson forest, taking the form of a powerful dragon that wants nothing but to devour prey and eat Angel-kind. This demon also tends to be one of Bayonetta’s signature summons.</p> 

<p>Fun-fact: Gomorrah is the demon Bayonetta summons the most for defeating Angel opponents. Gomorrah also makes an elephant noise when it roars.</p>

<h2>Malphas, Harbinger of Finality</h2>

<p>A massive demon bird with several eyes and a lust for the consumption of Angel flesh. A rather brutal demon that Bayonetta uses on flying opponents.</p>

<h2>Scolopendra, Eradicator of Paradise</h2>

<img src="scolopendra.png" alt="Demon">

<p>A creepy centipede-like demon that is said to reside in the boiling blood rivers in Inferno and said to be over 10-kilometers long. Scolopendra is a powerful and creepy demon Bayonetta utilizes in Bayonetta 1 and 2.</p>

<p>The Bayonetta has a massive pool of demons that have intense lore and interesting stories, however this is all I will cover for today!</p>
